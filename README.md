This repository includes the data and code for assignments completed in APBI 319 at UBC. Each folder contains the data and code necessary for one assignment, that answers a unique question. Data was sourced from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) via FishStatJ, and then organized using FishStatJ to make the CSV files.
